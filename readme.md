# Simple Tailwind CSS Starter

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

This is an extremley simple setup to develop Tailwind projects made while following Brad Traversy's [Tailwind CSS from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/) Course on Udemy.

## Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

```
npm run watch
```

You can use tailwind classes in any .html files in the root directory

Put any custom CSS that you may have in the **input.css** file

Add any config values to the **tailwind.config.js** file

To build once, run

```
npm run build
```

You only need to deploy your html files and css/style.css
